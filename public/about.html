<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Ronnie and I am an aspiring web developer. I worked in healthcare for 15 years before I decided it just wasn't for me.
  I then decided to take an aptitude test that gave me a result of web developer. I had no real clue what a web developer did, and it had 
never crossed my mind to be one. I decided to do some research and see what it was all about and signed up for a course online. From the 
moment I stated coding I was in love! I thought to myself, this is a career I can be happy with for the rest of my life! I started doing my
web development courses and never looked back. </p>
